I'm a student of Cognitive Science at the University of Osnabr체ck. My major subjects are **cognitive psychology** and **artificial intellgence** and I took part in a study project to re-translate and comment on Alan Turing's _"Computing Machinery and Intelligence"_, which will be published in Reclam Verlag's 'Great Papers Philosophie' series.
